Based on the results above, my research has succeeded in identifying tweets containing abusive words on Twitter social media. After testing and evaluating the analysis of tweets that containing abusive words.

dataset that i use is from kaggle.com, the link is https://www.kaggle.com/ilhamfp31/indonesian-abusive-and-hate-speech-twitter-text . I do manual data preprocessing to select features that I used to train.

i decided to do different training with many epochs and data splitting ratio variables to get the best hyperparameter for each method. For the dataset that i used, some conclusions that i got are :

For the CNN method, i got the maximum results when training with a splitting ratio of 70:30 and 25 epochs. The result is accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score values are 0.8946 or 89.46%.
